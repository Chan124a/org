2. insert the current chrome tab into place.
3. Learn GTD method now!

** Emacs as a C/C++ IDE
*** Jump to definition (of class, function, etc.)
1. Gtags
2. ycmd.

tips: Call helm-gtags-update in the .cpp file.

*** Autocompletion
ycmd + comapny-mode

*** On-the-fly syntax check
flycheck-ycmd

*** Find file in project
projectile and find-file-in-project

*** Compile??

*** Debugging??
