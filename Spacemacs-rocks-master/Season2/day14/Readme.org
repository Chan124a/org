* Spacemacs Rocks Season 2 (Day 14)
  
 Topic: File and Buffer operations

** Talk the difference between the configs of mine and spacemacs

** File related operations
1. =SPC p f= (find a file in current project, it looks like the Ctrl-p plugin in Vim)

I also do some hacks to enhance the =SPC p f=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun zilongshanren/open-file-with-projectile-or-counsel-git ()
  (interactive)
  (if (zilongshanren/vcs-project-root)
      (counsel-git)
    (if (projectile-project-p)
        (projectile-find-file)
      (ido-find-file))))
#+END_SRC

If it is in a Git repository, I use =counsel-git= to find file. Why not projectile? Becuase I think ivy-mode is much faster.
If it is in a proctile project, say it has a =.projectile= file in your project's root.
Otherwise, you =ido-find-file=

2. =SPC f f= to find a file start from the current directory

3. =SPC f L= find the file across the whole Mac system

4. =SPC f l= find file literally(I also enhance this func with ffap)

5. =SPC f h= find file in hex mode(I also enhance this func with ffap)

6. =SPC f o= open with external program

7. =SPC f E= sudo edit

8. =SPC f D= delete current file and buffer

9. =SPC f j= open the current file's dired mode

10. =SPC f r= find the recent file with ivy

11. =SPC f R= rename the current file

12. =SPC f v= add local variables

13. =SPC f y= yank current buffer's full path

14. =SPC f a d= find the current visited directory with fasd.

15. =SPC f C d/u= convert file encoding between unix and dos

16. =SPC f e d= find the .spacemacs/.spacemacs.d/init.el file

17. =SPC f e i= find the .emacs/.emacs.d/init.el init file

18. =SPC f e l= helm locate library file

19. =SPC f c= copy file

20. =SPC f b= show bookmarks

21. =SPC f s/S= save buffers

** buffer related operations
1. =SPC b .= buffer micro state (hydra)
2. =SPC b b= switch buffers, i rebind it to =ivy-switch-buffer=, because I could see recent use file in buffer
3. =SPC b d= kill a buffer
4. =SPC b f= find buffer file in finder
5. =SPC b B/i= I bind it to ibuffer
6. =SPC b h= go to home
7. =SPC b k=  kill matching buffers
8. =SPC b N= new empty buffer
9. =SPC b m= kill others
10. =SPC b R= safe revert buffer
11. =SPC b s= switch to scratch buffer
12. =SPC b w= toggle buffer read-only
13. =SPC b Y=  copy the whole buffer to clipboard, the content could be used in other programs
14. =SPC b P= paste to the whole buffer
15. =SPC  <tab>= switch between the current buffer and the last opened buffer

** Sometimes I also use the =Dired= mode to do all the files operations
I think I have talked about it in the previous videos.

** Happy hacking!
