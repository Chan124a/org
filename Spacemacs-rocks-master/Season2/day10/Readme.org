** How company-mode works?
1. backend for the completion sources and front end to display the candidates
2. C-h v company-backends
3. try company-file and company-ispell, M-x
4. C-h C-f to view the backend implementation

** Why my company sucks?
1.  Python anaconda-mode not works
2.  some backend require build with a server-client architecture: company-anaconda, company-jedi, company-ycmd, company-tern etc
3. At first, you should make sure the server side is working properly and then you want to make sure you use the right backend
4. how to fix anaconda on Mac
