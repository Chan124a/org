 Topic: Ctags and company mode for auto completion

** Why use Ctags for auto completion?
1. Some dynamic languages don't support syntax-aware auto completion.
For exampel:

Javascript (though tern-mode could do some sort of auto completion, but
the configuration is complex and it's not always reliable) && Lua

I also use Ctags for C/C++, I usually use Emacs for writing and navigating C/C++ code, but
use IDE to debug and profiling.

2. Ctags is very fast and reliable.

** How to configure ctags and auto completion?
ctags -eR .
company-etags (company-etags can't used for every major mode)

** How to use Ctags effectively?
1. project wide configurations for auto generating the Tags file.
2. Configure the ctags rules for generate more tags
3. use etags-select to quickly navigate a large code base

** Final thoughts
When syntax-aware auto completion is not available, consider to use Ctags instead.
