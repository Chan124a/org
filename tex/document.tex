	\section{Introduction}
	Theorems can easily be defined
	
	\begin{theorem}
		Let $f$ be a function whose derivative exists in every point, then $f$ is 
		a continuous function.
	\end{theorem}
	
	\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
		\label{pythagorean}
		This is a theorema about right triangles and can be summarised in the next 
		equation		\[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]
	\end{theorem}
	
	And a consequence of theorem \ref{pythagorean} is the statement in the next 
	corollary.
	
	\begin{corollary}
		There's no right rectangle whose sides measure 3cm, 4cm, and 6cm.
	\end{corollary}
	
	You can reference theorems such as \ref{pythagorean} when a label is assigned.
	
	\begin{lemma}
		Given two line segments whose lengths are $a$ and $b$ respectively there is a 
		real number $r$ such that $b=ra$.
	\end{lemma}
